# Catnip CTF  
**A Capture the Flag Challenge for N0H4Ts Cyberblitz Challenge 2024**

## Background

Hello, I'm Raccu, the nerdy raccoon. Have you ever visited a cat café? It's a paradise—free food, cozy massages, and no rent! Unfortunately, the owners aren't too keen on adding a raccoon to their team. Their loss, right? But I have a cunning plan to infiltrate their system and add myself to their database records.

I've already connected my computer to their server at `192.168.1.120` with port 8082 opened. Now, I just need a little help from you. Could you grant me remote access to their server? With that, I'll be able to sneak my way into their records and make myself an official member of the cat café crew!

## Goal

Obtain 2 flags.

> Helping raccu will let you obtain 2 flags.
