## Challenge breakdown:
- Server logs are provided to the players
- Trails of threat actor can be traced 
- players are to conduct an investigation 
- Determine the flag (How?)
- Flag is split into two parts and can be found in leaked and flag folder. The contents are encoded with secret key which can be found after investigation. Key #1: purple (Solved via riddle) Key #2 SingaporeInstituteOfTechnology (Solved via looking through ACRA csv)
- Combine both parts to get completed flag

Twist:
- leaked folder holds one half of flag
- flag folder holds the other half
