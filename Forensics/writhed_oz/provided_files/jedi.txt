Within the Star Wars galaxy, the‌‌‌‌‍‌‌﻿ Jedi are powerful guardians‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‍ of order and justice, who, through intuition, rigorous ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌‬training, and intensive self-discipline, are able‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‍ to wield a‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬ supernatural power known as the Force, thus‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‬ achieving the ability to move‌‌‌‌‍‬﻿‌ objects with the mind‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‍, perform incredible feats of strength, and connect to certain people's thoughts. The Jedi are depicted, in the franchise's Old Republic era, as a ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍‌monastic organization well-trained in the martial arts, who‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‬ cooperate intimately‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬﻿ with the‌‌‌‌‍‌﻿‍ galactic government‌‌‌‌‌﻿‍‌ and work towards bringing "peace into the galaxy ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‍by being ambassadors and troubleshooters‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿", according to Lucas. Jedi‌‌‌‌‍‍‍‌ characters investigate certain crimes ranging from high-profile murder to political corruption, act as diplomats ‌‌‌‌‍‬‬‌between powerful interplanetary groups‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌﻿, protect the highest government officials of the Republic, track down‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿ fugitives, and are promoted as‌‌‌‌‍‌‍‬ leaders in the Republic's army‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌‌ during the ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‌‬Clone Wars. Still, their creed ‌‌‌‌‍‬‌﻿demands that they ‌‌‌‌‌﻿‌﻿defend and protect‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿ all life and use their power only for knowledge and defense‌‌‌‌‍‌‌‬. With the rise‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‍ of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the ‌‌‌‌‍‬‍‍Galactic Empire, the Jedi Order is outlawed and most of its‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿ members killed in the ensuing‌‌‌‌‍﻿‍﻿ political purge. Later ‌‌‌‌‍‍﻿﻿efforts are made to ‌‌‌‌‍﻿‬‍revive the organization.
