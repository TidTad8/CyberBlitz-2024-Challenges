# Challenge 1: Possible

Difficulty: Easy
Prerequisites: Nil, first challenge 
Requirements: File type identification, Google search images, Social media navigation  

## Narrative:
Seems like we have a file here, can you find the flag?

## Challenge breakdown:
- jpg image file that is stripped of the extension will be provided, titled as video
- reverse search image to match > leads to certain social media platform
- search through platform for clues that gives the flag

The twist (players are to identify and discover this themselves):
- That is only one part of the flag
- There are two more parts at two other social media platforms

However, the flag will be in dec form from the ASCII table and to be converted to char form: 
67 121 98 101 114 66 108 105 116 122 123 115 51 51 109 115 95 108 49 107 51 95 49 116 115 95 110 48 116 95 116 104 52 116 95 49 109 112 48 115 115 49 98 108 51 95 59 41 125
