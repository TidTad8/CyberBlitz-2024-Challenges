## Question

> Rust is really versatile. First, you can write systems programming with Rust and suddenly realise it's not as scary, or have Rustâ€™s compiler flashing those friendly error messages, or have Rust stealing the bugs from your code and putting them on like, "Haha, fixed your bugs!" That's just way too cool! Also, Rust's ownership model! I really like when it enforces memory safety with that reassuring borrow checker gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really powerful or just be a learning aid. I really like how it can fulfil all those abstract coding needs. Being able to switch up the patterns and abstractions based on your project is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those zero-cost abstractions, or the fearless concurrency, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of features at a buffet. I really want more developers to try it out or replace their old tools with Rust. We really need Rust to become a thing in more codebases and start seeing it everywhere. Don't. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Embrace. Rust?

### Hint

-   First step seems to be a simple comparison
-   What is this magic function? It looks recursive.
-   There seems to be 2 functions named `ironoxide::levelthree`

## Setup Guide

`docker compose up -d ironoxide`

## Distribution

-   ironoxide: `a8585d06e7a360121c14c5f6a81f366d4668e04b0d5555a1775662730bd85064`

## Solution

TODO
