# Preparation
1. Run generate_keys.py
2. Run generate_signatures.py
3. Provided files: Two DER-encoded ECDSA signatures, encrypted flag

# Challenge Description
I have two DER-encoded ECDSA signatures generated by Alice's private key. The first signed message is "Message 1" and the second signed message is "Message 2". The signature algorithm uses the SECP256R1 curve. I noticed something weird on the two signatures, which allowed me to derive Alice's private key. That same key was also used to encrypt the flag with a symmetric cipher (AES in CBC mode). The IV is included at the start of the encrypted data.

# Solution Thought Process
1. The two signatures share the same r value, which indicates that they were produced with the same random value (a sign of a flawed PRNG implementation). 
2. Using the two formulas that produced the two signatures, solve for the two unknowns: the random value k and Alice's private key x.
3. x is also the AES key that encrypted the flag.
4. IV is known to be 16 bytes.
5. Use x and the IV to get the flag.
